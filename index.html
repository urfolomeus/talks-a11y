# Introduction

???

* Estimated that approximately 10-20% of people that use the web have
  a disability of some sort
* Historically JavaScript has caused accessibility issues
* Myths that Assistive Technology doesn't support JavaScript or that
  impaired users turn it off

# Impairments

???

* Let's start by taking a look at the type of impairments that people
  might have and how it might affect their usage of your web app

---

class: center, middle

## Visual

???

* This is the most obvious and widely talked about
* Blind users
  * use screen readers
  * more on how to help with this later
  * audio description on videos
* Partially-sighted users
  * user screen zooming (sometimes just magnifying glass)
  * ensure your content scales well
  * allow user to focus on content
  * Readability mode
* Colour blindness
  * use a valid colour scheme or allow user to choose one that suits them
  * try to include symbols as well as colours for indication
* Photosensitive
  * consider low-contrast or dark-themed version of the site
  * be aware polarised lenses can sometimes interfere with the ability
    to view the screen on some devices

---

class: center, middle

## Auditory

???

* Subtitles
* Transcription
* Translate to British Sign Language

---

class: center, middle

## Motor

???

* keyboard only input
* voice activation

---

class: center, middle

## Cognitive

???

* In some cases only so much you can do
* Pitch to the lowest reading level you need to
* Lay your content out well
* Be clear an concise in your message

---

class: center, middle

## Seizures

???

* Be aware that certain things can cause photoepileptic seizures

# Making your app accessible

???

* What are the ways in which you can make your content accessible to
  as many people as possible?

# ARIA

???

* Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications
* WAI-ARIA standard from W3C
* Way to add semantic information to elements through HTML/XML attributes
* Has three types of attributes: roles, properties and states

---

class: center, middle

## Ordinary markup

```html
<!-- fancy pants select -->
<ol class="select">
  <li class="option">Item 1</li>
  <li class="option">Item 2</li>
  <li class="option">Item 3</li>
</ol>
```

???

* Not semantic

---

class: center, middle

## Roles

```html
<!-- fancy pants select -->
<ol role="select">
  <li role="option">Item 1</li>
  <li role="option">Item 2</li>
  <li role="option">Item 3</li>
</ol>
```

???

* Describe the purpose of an element
* divs and spans do not have enough semantic information to derive purpose
* allow assistive devices to interact with a widget, such as a form, slider
  or tabbed view as if it were a desktop equivalent
* once a role is set it should not be changed
* if you need to change role use a new element instead

---

class: center, middle

## Properties

```html
<!-- fancy pants select -->
<ol role="select" aria-required="true">
  <li role="option">Item 1</li>
  <li role="option">Item 2</li>
  <li role="option">Item 3</li>
</ol>
```

???

* Define characteristics of an element
* required
* draggable
* associated modal

---

class: center, middle

## States

```html
<!-- fancy pants select -->
<ol role="select" aria-required="true">
  <li role="option" aria-selected="true">Item 1</li>
  <li role="option">Item 2</li>
  <li role="option">Item 3</li>
</ol>
```

???

* Indicate the current state of an element
* disabled
* checked
* busy
* hidden

---

class: center, middle

## Usage

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<div role="tooltip" aria-hidden="true">
  Hello, World
</div>
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
var showTip = function(el) {
  el.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'false');
}
```

```css
/* CSS */
div.tooltip                     { background: yellow }
div.tooltip[aria-hidden="true"] { display: none }
```

???

* use JavaScript to set the state or property and then
  use CSS attribute selectors to add style etc.

---

class: center, middle

## Live regions

```html
<select id="bird-selector" aria-controls="bird-info">
  <option>Chaffinch</option>
  <option>Blackbird</option>
  <option>Robin</option>
</select>

<div role="region" id="bird-info" aria-live="polite"></div>
```

???

* Let you indicate that an element will be updated without a page refresh
* aria-live indicates that the element is a live region
  * off (default) = no notification on update
  * polite = waits until user takes a break until it notifies them
  * assertive = notifies the user straight away
* aria-control indicates the live region that the control updates
* WARNING: not fully adopted in all browsers

---

class: center, middle

## Live regions

```html
<ul id="roster" aria-live="polite" aria-relevant="additions removals">
  <!-- use JavaScript to add remove users here-->
</ul>
```

???

* advanced options
  * atomic = when true notifies all contents of live region, when false only notifies changed items
  * relevant = only notifies on add and/or update and/or removal
  * labelledBy
  * describedBy

---

# Accessibility Gotchas

???

* JavaScript allows you to do some powerful things
* But there is a reason that it sometimes gets a bad rap in the a11y world
* With great power yada yada

---

class: center, middle

## Adding new content without user's knowledge

???

* Adding new content to the page that Assistive Devices can't see

---

class: center, middle

## Use of indicators that some users can't see

???

* Rollover effects that are missed by screen readers
* Highlights/links that are missed by the colour blind

---

class: center, middle

## Usurping the browser/OS default controls

???

* Breaking, or worse changing, the default browser/OS controls

---

class: center, middle

## Death by a thousand notifications

???

* Constantly changing/updating content

---

class: center, middle

## Worm holes

???

* Moving the position of the user within the page without warning

---

class: center, middle

## Lack of control/flexibility

???

* Locking them in to your apps control system and making it
  hard or impossible to get out

---



class: center, middle

# How much should you do?

???

---

class: center, middle

## Be realistic

???

* You have a limited amount of time/money
* Is it possible for your content to be consumed by a group
  even with the best a11y you can manage (i.e. severe cognitive issues)?

---

class: center, middle

## Accessible by default?

???

* There is definitely low hanging fruit
* For example, many javascript UI libs have a11y built in

---

class: center, middle

## Altruistic vs. Savvy

???

* You shouldn't cut users off from your content just because you haven't
  factored in time to make it available to them
* On the one hand you may want to take the time to make your app available
  to anyone
* On the other hand you may want to try some research to prove that there is
  a genuine need for the support
